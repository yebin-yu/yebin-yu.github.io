[Work content]:
1. Trouble-shooting expert team members: Help the domain or test engineers identify problems that they cannot solve, and support the smooth version delivery. In addition, if there are problems on the live network, we will organize personnel to solve the problems in an emergency manner.
2. Leader of the tool team: Maintain existing tools and develop new ones, and help the team and other teams write automation scripts.
3. Owner of the system support part: Customize files and support some functions of the small system using Python and Shell scripts, according to the customer’s requirements and scenarios. In addition, develop and maintain functions such as memory optimization, disk management, data security, and process control.

[Achievement]:
- After being the owner of the process configuration module, I spent one month refactoring the process configuration module and finally fully autoamted this module. This helped me win the 2022 Reconstruction elite reward.
- As the project manager of one of the top priority project. I developed the entire project from 0 to 1 on my own, with full stack development. Including load balance, distributed system and all the data design. Currently, the average monthly usage is over 2500 times, which is expected to save more than 200 man-month each year.

I joined Huawei as an outsourced employee and became a regular one after a year. I'm currently the PL of the metropolitan router system expert group.
I have received many awards, such as Refactoring Elite, Tomorrow’s Star, Software Top 100, and the President’s Award in 2023.

1. I lead the team to solve urgent issues in the production environment efficiently and provide professional diagnosis for complex problems in other domains.
2. I collaborate with other expert groups, form a joint team and a knowledge management team for problem diagnosis. After the team is appointed, we establish the standards and procedures for expert group assistance and ensure the standardization and consistency of diagnosis manuals and cases.
3. Based on the standardized diagnosis manual, I independently designed and built an automatic diagnosis tool platform from scratch, which achieved automatic diagnosis function and unified ownership information, saving at least 500 person-months of work per year.
4. After taking over the domains such as kernel trimming, memory allocation, process configuration deployment, etc., I created the original engineering configuration, which enabled the domain to handle CRUD operations by itself, reducing the human cost of communication and maintenance.
